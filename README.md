## Purpose

The aim of this application is to learn AngularJS with Typescript working with the Visual Studio Code editor.
Very little attention was paid to the Web Design and optimisation side of it as my main focus was learning Typescript.

Technologies used:
- Typescript - a typed superset of JavaScript (www.typescriptlang.org/) 
- AngularJS - SPA framework (https://angularjs.org/)
- NodeJS - Server side javascript (https://nodejs.org/)
- ExpressJS - Web app framework for nodejs (http://expressjs.com/)
- lodash - LINQ for JS (https://lodash.com/)
- Boostrap - CSS framework (http://getbootstrap.com/)
- Gulp - build pipeline (http://gulpjs.com/)
- wiredep - dynamically linking bower packages to your html (https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep)
- Heroku - hosting (https://www.heroku.com/)
